# StayFitBlog

## Introduction
Hello, I'm Yordanos A, a computer science student at the University of the People. As part of my coursework in Introduction to Software Engineering at Alx, I have created StayFitBlog. This blog web app is inspired by personal experiences and is aimed at raising awareness and providing support for women's health issues, specifically postpartum depression and lupus.

## Inspiration
StayFitBlog was conceived out of a need to shine a light on postpartum depression and lupus, two significant health issues often overshadowed by a lack of public awareness. Witnessing my sister's struggle with lupus spurred me to create a platform that not only educates but also fosters a community of support and understanding.

- Enhance awareness about postpartum depression and lupus.
